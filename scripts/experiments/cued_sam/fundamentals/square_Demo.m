% Make a base Rect of 200 by 200 pixels. This is the rect which defines the
% size of our square in pixels. Rects are rectangles, so the
% sides do not have to be the same length. The coordinates define the top
% left and bottom right coordinates of our rect [top-left-x top-left-y
% bottom-right-x bottom-right-y]. The easiest thing to do is set the first
% two coordinates to 0, then the last two numbers define the length of the
% rect in X and Y. The next line of code then centers the rect on a
% particular location of the screen.
baseRect = [0 0 200 200];

% Set the color of our square to full red. Color is defined by red green
% and blue components (RGB). So we have three numbers which
% define our RGB values. The maximum number for each is 1 and the minimum
% 0. So, "full red" is [1 0 0]. "Full green" [0 1 0] and "full blue" [0 0
% 1]. Play around with these numbers and see the result.
